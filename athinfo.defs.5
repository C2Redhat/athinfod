.SH NAME
athinfo.defs \- Define athinfo queries
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/athena/athinfo.defs
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.B /etc/athena/athinfo.defs
defines the queries understood by the athinfo daemon (see
.BR athinfod (8)).
Blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.  Each line
consists of a word giving the query name and a command to be executed
by /bin/sh in response to the query.  The command executed will not
receive input from the athinfo client.  For security reasons, the
command should not depend on a network filesystem.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following example defines two queries, one to display the routing
table and another to display the rc.conf file.
.PP
.RS
.nf
# Query		Command

routes		netstat -rn
rc.conf		cat /etc/athena/rc.conf
